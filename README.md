# dotnet-win-container
Containerized .NET Framework app deployed with GtiHub Actions!

Status: YELLOW - the actions work perfect, but the actual deployment of the framework application doesn't.  Might be a code issue

Docker Status: RED - It deploys to dockerhub, but the App Service doesn't work properly
